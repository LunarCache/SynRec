## Introduction

Multi-domain recommendation (MDR) aims to enhance recommendation performance across various domains. However, real-world recommender systems in online platforms often need to handle dozens or even hundreds of domains, far exceeding the capabilities of traditional MDR algorithms, which typically focus on fewer than five domains. Key challenges include a substantial increase in parameter count, high maintenance costs, and intricate knowledge transfer patterns across domains. Furthermore, minor domains often suffer from data sparsity, leading to inadequate training in classical methods.

To address these issues, we propose Adaptive REcommendation for All Domains with counterfactual augmentation (AREAD). AREAD employs a hierarchical expert structure (HEI) and learns domain-specific expert network selection masks (HEMP) with counterfactual augmentation. Our experiments on two public datasets, each encompassing over twenty domains, demonstrate AREAD's effectiveness, especially in data-sparse domains.

## Datasets

For our experiments, we utilize two widely recognized datasets: the **Amazon dataset** and the **AliCCP dataset**. Both datasets are structured around item categories, serving as distinct domains for our recommendation tasks. Sample data files are included in the repository folders (`dataset/aliccp` and `dataset/amazon`) to facilitate initial setup and verification. To perform full-scale training and harness the complete capabilities of AREAD, users are required to download the complete datasets from the provided links.

### Cloud-Theme Dataset

For those interested in testing recommendation algorithms across large-scale domains, the Cloud-Theme dataset may be a useful resource. This dataset includes over 1.4 million clicks across 355 distinct scenarios during a 6-day promotional period, supplemented by one month's purchase history of users before the promotion started. The label `clk_cnt` represents the number of times a user clicked on an item in the current session. Adapting this dataset for a common CTR task may require additional negative sampling techniques.

During the rebuttal phase of our paper, in response to reviewer comments, we conducted small-scale experiments using baseline models and our proposed AREAD on the Cloud-Theme dataset. Consequently, our repository includes preprocessing scripts for this dataset. We chose not to publish the experimental results as we have not yet performed comprehensive preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning on the dataset. Publishing these preliminary results without rigorous validation could compromise the fairness and integrity of our results.
